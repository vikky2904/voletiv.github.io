## About Me

I am currently a researcher under Prof. C. V. Jawahar at the Applied Research Lab, CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad. My current work is on weakly supervised lipreading using deep neural networks. I am experimenting with convolutional and recurrent neural networks to achieve standard benchmarks in visual speech recognition.

Previously, I worked as an Image Processing Engineer at GreyOrange Robotics in the Embedded Systems team. I was involved in designing computer vision modules for real time video processing and pattern recognition for warehouse automation and autonomos robots. Before that, I worked in Airbus, India, in the Avionics Software and Systems Testing group. I was involved in development and validation of avionincs systems in the Flight Warning Computer for aircrafts in the long-range family.

I graduated from IIT Kharagpur, India, in 2014 with a Dual Degree (B.Tech. (H) + M.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering, my Master's specialization being Instrumentation and Signal Processing. My Bachelor's and Master's thesis were in the areas of computer vision, image processing, machine learning.

## Research Interests

To work at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning towards artificial intelligence; to
understand and apply learning techniques such as deep neural networks to vision-related research
