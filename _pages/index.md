I am currently a researcher under [Prof. C. V. Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/){:target="_blank"} at the Applied Research Lab, [CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in){:target="_blank"}. I work on projects involving translation of videos to a different language using deep learning, with applications in movie dubbing and educational video dubbing. I also work on visual speech recognition, and semantic segmentation for urban scenes.

I am also a Mentor for the [Foundations of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://www.talentsprint.com/aiml.dpl){:target="_blank"} certificate program by IIIT-H Machine Learning Lab. I assist in creating tutorials on machine learning, and mentor participants in lab sessions. 

Previously, I worked at [GreyOrange Robotics](http://www.greyorange.com/){:target="_blank"} on computer vision modules for real time pattern recognition in videos for warehouse automation, and on autonomous robots; and at [Airbus, India](http://www.airbus.com/){:target="_blank"} on software development and integration.

I graduated from [IIT Kharagpur, India](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}, in 2014 with a Dual Degree (B.Tech. (H) + M.Tech.) in Electrical Engineering, my Master's specialization was Instrumentation and Signal Processing.
