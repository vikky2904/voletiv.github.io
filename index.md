## About Me

I am currently a researcher under Prof. C. V. Jawahar at the Applied Research Lab, CVIT, IIIT-Hyderabad.

Previously, I worked as an Image Processing Engineer at GreyOrange Robotics, a multinational firm that designs, manufactures and deploys advanced robotics systems for automation at warehouses, distribution and fulfillment centres. My job was to developed a computer vision module to perform video processing in real time for warehouse automation. We made an "Empty Carriage Detection System" (ECDS) for the "Cross-Belt Sorter" (CBS) that detects in real time whether a carriage in a conveyor belt has a packet on it or not, and relays the information to the server and mechanical systems. I also helped develop the embedded vision module in automated guided robots for warehouses, called "Butlers".

## Research Interests

To work at the intersection of computer vision and machine learning towards artificial intelligence; to
understand and apply learning techniques such as deep neural networks to vision-related research
